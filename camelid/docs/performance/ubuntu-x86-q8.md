# Ubuntu x86 Q8 Performance Work

## Status

This is an active, evidence-gated performance lane. Optimized paths are default-off while validation continues.

The current goal is production-directional runtime improvement on a narrow Ubuntu x86_64 dense-Q8 lane. It is not a production-ready or broad platform claim.

## What changed

- Added and validated default-off AVX2 Q8 acceleration paths in the measured Ubuntu x86 lane.
- Added packed Q8 runtime storage work for selected dense tensors.
- Kept matrix-level Q8 GEMM/MUL_MAT as an evidence-gated direction while documenting concrete default-off FFN/attention/output slices by their per-artifact evidence level; local-only follow-ons are not Ubuntu x86_64 validation.
- Separated cold materialization from warm inference.
- Documented rejected candidates when they failed parity, wall-clock, or clean-host discipline.

## Validated principles

- Warm inference should not rebuild packed rows.
- Cold materialization and warm decode are separate problems.
- `from_q8_0_bytes` is cold/reload-only on the measured Ubuntu x86 lane.
- Row-dot micro-optimizations are not enough by themselves.
- Matrix-level ownership remains a direction, not a support or throughput claim until a fresh Ubuntu x86_64 run proves a concrete default-off path.
- Retain decisions require parity plus repeated wall-clock evidence on a clean host.

## Current retained paths

Only list the paths that are currently evidence-backed and default-off:

- `CAMELID_X86_Q8_REPACK=on` for the retained Ubuntu x86 runtime-packed lane used in current evidence.
- AVX2 packed-kernel work in the measured Ubuntu x86 lane where parity and bounded timing evidence support keeping the path under default-off gating.
- Packed Q8 runtime storage for the dense attention projection family plus dense FFN gate/up/down rows in the measured lane.
- Default-off decode consumers that directly use backend-owned packed runtime storage for narrow one-row dense projection families, including output, attention Q/K/V, attention output, FFN down, and the FFN gate/up activation slice while validation remains opt-in.
- Default-off packed-rows4 matmul slices consume backend-owned packed runtime storage for concrete dense projection families with per-slice evidence recorded below: FFN down, multi-row FFN gate/up, multi-row attention Q/K/V, multi-row attention output, and local-only multi-row `output.weight`; the newest chunked output-group traversal and quantized-input scratch-reuse follow-ons are local-only until Ubuntu timing/profiling validation is recorded. This is planner/runtime-gate/allocation-shape evidence, not a blanket throughput, support, portability, or default-on claim.
- Default-off FFN-down GEMM4 follow-ons now include prefill, row-group scheduling, a retained min-input-groups scheduler guard, and an AVX2 experiment gate. Current public docs retain these as developer experiments only: canonical Ubuntu parity plus repeated same-host timing/profiling evidence is still required before any throughput/RSS/support/default-on claim.
- The default-off `CAMELID_X86_Q8_FFN_DOWN_VNNI_DECODE_RAWPTR` helper is a narrow Rust AVX512-VNNI decode-kernel experiment for the existing FFN-down VNNI sidecar. It is not a default path and has no support or public performance promotion without fresh same-host evidence.
- ExecutionPlan now treats the x86 attention Q/K/V, attention-output, output, FFN gate/up/down decode-consumer, FFN gate/up single-owner, packed-rows4 FFN-down matmul, packed-rows4 FFN gate/up matmul, packed-rows4 attention-Q/K/V matmul, packed-rows4 attention-output matmul, packed-rows4 output matmul, packed-rows4 serial decode disable, parallel input quantize, FFN-down GEMM4, and FFN-down VNNI raw-pointer flags as managed default-off knobs, so appliance planning clears stale owner experiments instead of inheriting them accidentally.

## Active experimental direction

Current work is focused on:

- explicit `CAMELID_X86_Q8_KERNEL=avx2` packed-kernel execution
- matrix-level Q8 GEMM/MUL_MAT ownership only after a concrete default-off flag/path has fresh Ubuntu x86_64 evidence
- FFN projection optimization, especially deeper `ffn_down` decode ownership and one-quantization FFN gate/up decode consumption
- attention projection optimization, including narrow one-row Q/K/V decode-consumer and multi-row Q/K/V or attention-output packed-runtime matmul slices only when guarded by fresh Ubuntu x86_64 evidence; current Q/K/V helpers use one shared input quantization and paired/triplet projection helpers under existing default-off gates.
- output-group scheduling for one-row packed-runtime decode consumers, including the latest local-only helper that can parallelize wide rows4 decode projections inside existing default-off gates; Ubuntu timing/profiling proof is still pending before retaining any measured effect.
- multi-row output projection ownership through backend-owned packed runtime storage; the current `CAMELID_X86_Q8_OUTPUT_PACKED_ROWS4_MATMUL` slice has local parity/gate evidence only; no Ubuntu timing/profiling validation is recorded for that local slice.
- bounded packed-rows4 matmul scheduling follow-ons that reduce Rayon task granularity by chunking output groups across single/pair/triplet helpers; current proof is local semantic coverage only, not a retained Ubuntu speed claim.
- bounded packed-rows4 matmul activation-quantization scratch reuse, so existing default-off single/pair/triplet matmul consumers can reuse cleared thread-local input blocks rather than allocating a fresh quantized-input vector per helper call; current proof is local allocation-shape/timing-smoke coverage only, not a retained Ubuntu speed claim.
- bounded attention Q/K/V decode group chunking, so the existing default-off QKV decode triplet can reduce Rayon task fan-out across output groups under `CAMELID_X86_Q8_ATTENTION_QKV_DECODE_GROUP_CHUNKING=on`; current proof is local parity/control-plane coverage only, not a retained Ubuntu timing/profiling claim.
- bounded FFN gate/up decode group chunking, so the existing default-off paired gate/up decode consumer can reduce Rayon task fan-out across output groups under `CAMELID_X86_Q8_FFN_GATE_UP_DECODE_GROUP_CHUNKING=on`; current proof is local parity/control-plane coverage only, not a retained Ubuntu timing/profiling claim.
- FFN-down GEMM4 AVX2 and output-route-resolver cleanup are evidence-needed tracer bullets: keep them default-off, preserve backend-owned packed runtime storage, and require parity plus same-host guard evidence before retaining any performance claim.
- Rust-only FFN-down VNNI decode inner-loop ownership under `CAMELID_X86_Q8_FFN_DOWN_VNNI_DECODE_RAWPTR=on`, scoped to Ubuntu/Linux x86_64 AVX512-VNNI and backed by the current source archaeology that identifies llama.cpp decode as AMX-buffer-backed one-row VNNI. This remains evidence-needed until same-host parity and timing are recorded.
- Default-off VNNI decode scale-cache cleanup keeps raw fp16 scale bits for layout parity while carrying decoded f32 scale lanes in the VNNI sidecar. Current proof is local Rust parity/gates only; no Ubuntu timing/profiling validation is recorded for this slice.
- FFN-down row-group scheduling now has a retained default-off min-input-groups guard for the shallow-prefill synthetic surface; model-backed same-host FFN-down timing remains evidence-needed before any measured throughput claim.
- reducing wrapper/callback overhead in hot inference
- keeping the default/reference path safe while experimental paths stay opt-in

## Rejected paths

Rejected paths stay documented when they fail for any of the following reasons:

- no wall-clock win
- parity fail
- contaminated host
- microbench-only improvement
- old-baseline-only improvement
- context-switch regression

Examples already treated this way include row-dot lookalikes, tile16 hsum/lane/simd-scale variants, wrapper-style GEMM detours, and contaminated benchmark runs.

## Clean-host discipline

Ubuntu x86 Q8 benchmarking now requires a clean host before major runs:

- check disk headroom
- inspect stale Camelid / perf / benchmark jobs
- clear conflicting ports
- remove abandoned scratch trees from invalid runs
- preserve retained evidence and model files

Contaminated runs are not used as retained evidence.

## Host-status reporting

Do not present any negative host-access state for the canonical Ubuntu validation host unless the canonical SSH probe was executed in the same run and the exact stderr is cited in the evidence bundle. The canonical probe is the operator-provided private SSH command for the current run. Do not publish the host address, user, key path, or full command in repository files.

If remote validation was not attempted in the run, say that plainly instead of implying host failure.

Historical notes about operator-paused validation lanes are not current host-access evidence. Keep them framed as historical execution posture, not as proof of today's host state.

## How to reproduce

Use only the current reference default-off gates for the retained Ubuntu x86_64 experiment and keep the host clean before running:

```bash
CAMELID_X86_Q8_REPACK=on \
CAMELID_X86_Q8_KERNEL=avx2
```

Do not add older sketch flags or matrix-owner placeholders to reproduction commands unless a fresh Ubuntu x86_64 evidence entry proves that exact flag and shape. Narrow decode-consumer/owner flags are separate default-off developer experiments; enable them only when the current evidence report names the exact flag and validation target for that slice.

For bounded warm-request measurement, use the same host, same model, same request shape, repeated runs, parity checks, and paired `perf stat` / `perf record` evidence.

## Product/runtime note

Camelid is moving toward an appliance-style execution plan where validated runtime paths can be selected automatically while experimental acceleration remains opt-in.

The intended product/runtime mode split is:

- `safe`
- `auto`
- `experimental`
- `debug`

This note does **not** claim full multi-model runner orchestration today. It describes the direction for exposing validated runtime behavior more clearly without pushing env-var complexity onto normal users.
