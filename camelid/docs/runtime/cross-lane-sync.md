# Runtime Cross-Lane Sync

This file is the shared bridge between Camelid's Ubuntu x86 Q8 performance lane, Mac arm64 Q8/product UX lane, and ExecutionPlan/runtime product lane.

Rules:
- Do not mix evidence across platforms.
- Ubuntu numbers are Ubuntu-only.
- Mac numbers are Mac-only.
- Report Ubuntu validation status as evidence status, not host-access status. If remote validation was not attempted for the current slice, say so; do not imply any negative host-access state unless the canonical SSH probe was run in the same slice and the stderr is captured in the evidence bundle.
- Architecture lessons can be shared.
- Kernel implementations cannot be blindly copied.
- Mac must not copy AVX2 assumptions.
- Ubuntu must not assume Apple Silicon behavior.
- Product/runtime should expose and select only validated paths.

## Latest cross-lane digests

### Cross-lane sync

Source lane: Ubuntu x86 Q8 / Discord

Finding: `d9ad412` caches the x86 Q8 kernel gate outside hot dot loops; proof remains pending and the active P0 is runtime-overhead validation, not new kernel tuning.

Why it matters: Hot-path env/config reads can dominate optimized kernels and invalidate benchmark conclusions if path sanity is not captured first.

Applies to: Mac arm64 Q8 and Product/ExecutionPlan as an architecture/process lesson: audit hot inference paths for env/config/rwlock reads and expose selected runtime paths before benchmarks.

Does not apply to: Mac performance numbers, Apple Silicon kernel choices, or any claim that Ubuntu AVX2 evidence proves Mac behavior.

Action for other lane: Mac should audit env/config/rwlock hot paths before trusting Q8 results; Product/ExecutionPlan should expose selected backend and Q8 path in `/health` and `/api/capabilities` before benchmark runs.

Evidence / file / commit: `d9ad412 Cache x86 Q8 kernel gate outside hot dot loops`; merged to `origin/main` by `49349db`; source file `src/inference.rs`.

Owner: Cross-lane sync owner; Ubuntu proof owner retains numeric validation.

### Cross-lane sync

Source lane: Mac arm64 Q8 / Cameleer

Finding: Mac packed-prefill stays default-off/experimental because retained Mac evidence favors the existing auto/direct-pack path over RSS-only packed-prefill wins.

Why it matters: Product defaults should not promote a path that improves memory while regressing wall-clock/prefill compute on the same platform.

Applies to: Ubuntu and Product/ExecutionPlan as a process lesson: require balanced evidence and keep experimental profiles explicit.

Does not apply to: Ubuntu timings, AVX2 gates, or any claim that Mac packed-prefill evidence proves Ubuntu packed-runtime behavior.

Action for other lane: Ubuntu should avoid promoting RSS-only or micro-kernel-only wins without warm wall-clock/path sanity; Product should keep experimental paths opt-in.

Evidence / file / commit: `docs/runtime/cross-lane-sync.md`; prior Mac retained path notes summarized in this document.

Owner: Cross-lane sync owner; Mac lane owner retains Mac numeric validation.

### Cross-lane sync

Source lane: Product / ExecutionPlan / runtime UX

Finding: Benchmarks need product-visible selected backend/Q8 path/profile before results are treated as optimized-path evidence.

Why it matters: If a run silently selects `cpu_reference` or `safe_q8_0_block_dot`, it is safe/reference evidence, not optimized packed-Q8 evidence.

Applies to: Ubuntu x86 Q8 and Mac arm64 Q8 benchmark discipline.

Does not apply to: Any numeric performance transfer between Ubuntu and Mac, or any claim that UX visibility validates a kernel.

Action for other lane: Capture selected backend, selected Q8 path, active profile, gates, and packed-runtime state with every major benchmark.

Evidence / file / commit: `docs/runtime/cross-lane-sync.md`; ExecutionPlan visibility requirements for `/health` and `/api/capabilities`.

Owner: Cross-lane sync owner; Product/ExecutionPlan owner implements UX/runtime exposure.

## Current Ubuntu x86 Q8 status

- Current evidence posture: keep public status evidence-scoped. This sync note does not establish host availability or failure; where no current remote run was attempted, say that no Ubuntu timing/profiling validation is recorded for the slice.
- Latest docs/context host-reporting retained audit (`qa/evidence-bundles/llamacpp-q8-cpu-re-20260514T1200Z/artifacts/cron-5e4b0b83-20260520T1244Z-docs-context-host-reporting-audit/README.md`) passed the public docs/context scan for stale host-access wording and private host aliases. Remote validation was not attempted in that docs-only audit.
- Recent retained control-plane/scheduler hygiene includes the FFN-down GEMM4 row-group min-input-groups guard. That evidence is default-off, synthetic scheduler evidence only; it is not broad throughput, support, portability, RSS, or default-on evidence.
- Runtime/config hot-path overhead remains a benchmark-validity lesson: path sanity must precede new Q8 kernel or owner experiments.
- `f65eac8` runtime-plan candidate is rejected: it timed out and still showed `getenv` / env-lock contention dominating.
- Surgical root cause found: `x86_q8_kernel_avx2_enabled()` was reading `CAMELID_X86_Q8_KERNEL` inside hot Q8 dot paths, effectively per Q8 block / packed rows4 group.
- Surgical fix branch: `camelid-runtime-overhead`.
- Surgical fix commit: `d9ad412 Cache x86 Q8 kernel gate outside hot dot loops`.
- This document records no retained before/after timing/profiling promotion for `d9ad412`; do not treat it as an accepted performance result until warm timing, parity, path sanity, and top-symbol evidence pass.
- Owner/kernel A/B work should not resume from this sync note alone; require fresh same-host path sanity plus parity/timing evidence for the exact default-off flag under test.
- `3244b35` is rejected as an active packed-runtime baseline: packed-runtime smoke timed out and safe/control was catastrophically slow.
- `80f6271` is an infrastructure anchor only, not a usable performance baseline.
- `83063cf` is historical retained evidence only, not a packed-runtime implementation baseline.

## Current Mac arm64 Q8 / product UX status

- Mac packed-prefill remains default-off / experimental.
- Reason: repeatability evidence showed RSS improved, but wall-clock and prefill compute regressed versus the retained Mac auto/direct-pack path.
- Mac auto profile should remain on the last proven retained path, not packed-prefill.
- ExecutionPlan/appliance UX work is moving forward:
  - safe / auto / experimental / debug profile concepts
  - selected plan exposure in `/health`
  - selected path/capability exposure in `/api/capabilities`
  - appliance-style runtime behavior for product use
- Mac must audit hot inference paths for the same env/config/rwlock issue Ubuntu found.

## Shared lessons

- Separate cold materialization from warm inference. Do not treat packed-row build/load cost as warm decode unless evidence proves it is happening in warm decode.
- Expose selected backend and selected Q8 path before benchmarking. If a run reports `cpu_reference` / `safe_q8_0_block_dot`, label it as safe/reference evidence, not optimized packed-Q8 evidence.
- Remove env/config/rwlock reads from hot inference paths. Per-layer, per-projection, per-row, or per-block `getenv` calls are performance bugs.
- Benchmark only clean-host runs. Capture disk, process, and port state before major runs.
- Do not promote RSS-only wins if wall-clock regresses.
- Default-off experimental paths must stay default-off.
- Baseline/gate drift can invalidate days of work; record exact SHA and gates.
- Row-dot micro-tuning is not enough if matrix ownership and runtime scheduling are wrong.
- Server/harness failures must distinguish real server crashes from script cleanup artifacts.

## Platform-specific lessons

### Ubuntu x86 Q8

- AVX2-specific gates and kernels are Ubuntu/x86 evidence only.
- `CAMELID_X86_Q8_KERNEL` should be resolved once per process for the hot Q8 kernel gate; changing that env var after process start should not be expected to affect a running server.
- Path sanity is mandatory before perf: selected backend, selected Q8 path, active profile, active gates, packed runtime active/not active.
- Owner/kernel A/B must stay paused until runtime overhead proof passes.

### Mac arm64 Q8

- Apple Silicon decisions must be based on Mac evidence only.
- Packed-prefill RSS improvement was not enough because wall-clock regressed.
- Mac must audit for hot-path env/config/rwlock reads before trusting new kernel results.
- Mac should use ExecutionPlan-selected validated paths rather than ad hoc env-var piles.

### Product / ExecutionPlan

- ExecutionPlan should be the product-facing way to select validated paths.
- Profiles must remain explicit: safe, auto, experimental, debug.
- `/health` and `/api/capabilities` should make selected plan/path visible enough to prevent invalid benchmarks.
- Product should consume only validated, evidence-backed paths.

## Active baselines / anchors

- Ubuntu active retained evidence: historical `83063cf` only for old retained sanity; not a packed-runtime baseline.
- Ubuntu default-off scheduler guard: FFN-down GEMM4 row-group min-input-groups threshold retained for the bounded synthetic scheduler surface only; model-backed same-host timing remains evidence-needed before any throughput claim.
- Ubuntu runtime-overhead candidate: `d9ad412` remains evidence-needed in this sync note; no retained before/after timing/profiling promotion is recorded here.
- Mac active auto path: retained direct-pack/I8MM-style path with packed-prefill off.
- Mac packed-prefill: rejected for promotion, default-off/experimental only.

## Rejected or paused paths

- Older FFN-down GEMM4 shorthand experiments: rejected for promotion where parity held but wall/`ffn_down` timing regressed; use only the current documented default-off flags when a fresh evidence bundle names the exact gate and shape.
- `3244b35` as active packed-runtime baseline: rejected; timeout/catastrophic safe-control timing.
- `f65eac8`: rejected runtime-overhead candidate; `getenv`/env-lock still dominated and request timed out.
- FFN-down owner and attention-output owner: do not resume from stale status alone; require fresh exact-flag evidence with path sanity, parity, timing, and a clean harness/server distinction.
- Mac packed-prefill promotion: rejected; default-off/experimental only.

## What each lane should not repeat

- Ubuntu: do not benchmark against wrong histories or missing gates; do not proceed without path sanity. If the canonical SSH command was not attempted in the current run, report remote validation as not attempted rather than implying host outage/auth failure.
- Mac: do not promote RSS-only improvements; audit env/config hot-path overhead before trusting kernel wins.
- Product: do not let runtime path selection become an unobservable env-var pile.

## Next action per lane

- Ubuntu: record the next model-backed same-host FFN-down timing/profiling proof for the retained default-off scheduler guard, or explicitly mark remote validation as not attempted; keep `d9ad412` performance promotion evidence-needed until a retained before/after bundle exists.
- Mac: audit hot inference paths for env/config/rwlock reads and ensure selected plan/path are visible before benchmarks.
- Product/ExecutionPlan: keep turning validated paths into explicit profiles and health/capability visibility.
- Sync owner: post short cross-lane digests whenever either lane finds a major lesson, accepted path, rejected path, or benchmark-validity rule.
